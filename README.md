# The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Mental Health in the Tech  Industry

This data science project is being conducted for a course at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. It focuses on exploring mental health within the technology industry before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, using data analysis techniques learned in the classroom. The project aims to analyze data from previous years as well as current data to gain insights into changes in mental health in the tech industry over time. 

## The DataSet

The OSMI Mental Health in Tech Survey is a collection of data related to mental health issues among individuals working in the tech industry. The survey was conducted by the Open Sourcing Mental Illness (OSMI) organization and includes responses from various tech-related fields. The data includes information on demographics, job roles, types of mental health conditions, treatment methods, and workplace attitudes towards mental health. The survey used in our project was conduced from 2017 to 2021, therefore we separated them in two groups: pre-pandemic (2017-2019) and during pandemic (2020-2021).
